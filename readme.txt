[b]Important Info:[/b]
This Mod was adapted for use in SMF 2.1. by @rjen

[b]Description:[/b]
Adds a list of all users that were online on the current day to the 'Info Center'. This is a simple mod that does the job and not a whole lot more. I like to keep it simple.

[b]Features:[/b]
- By hovering the cursor over the username, it will display when the user was last logged in
- The time period that the user list shows can be the current day, last 24 hours or last week
- The list can be sorted in various ways
- Viewing of the list can be restricted

This mod is hooks only: no file edits.

[b]Upgrading:[/b]
Just uninstall whatever version you've installed and install the latest one.
